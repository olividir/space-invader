# space-invader

A Space invader game I made by using **Abdullah Aghazadah** tutorial on YouTube, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t1VXHICv-Q&list=PLMgDVIa0Pg8VP1XqOexsdYP1FralBJP1l)

If you want to play this game, then:
	- Clone this repository
	- If on Mac or Linux, open terminal and cd into the directory where the game is
	- If on Windows, it should be enough to open the game.py file with your python interpeter and run.
	
This game needs Kivy to run, if you do not have Kivy installed, then look at this [documentation](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html) and click on your operating system, then follow the guide.

I am having small problem with the "shooting" sound, but it saturates the audio devices. You may or may not experience the same problem.
